# Admin Repository
Due to deployment issues and a certain structure being needed, the code for this project can be found in this repositiory: [Evergreen-Budgeting-App](https://github.com/kirstyb2003/evergreen-budgeting-app). The app can be found deployed [here](https://evergreen-budgeting-app.web.app).

This repository contains all the admin for my fourth year project. Here you can find:
- My dissertation source code and compiled pdf
- My final presentation and the recordings submitted
- The meeting minutes for all meetings with my supervisor Dr Sofiat Oloasebikan can be found in the wiki [here](https://github.com/kirstyb2003/Personal-Budget-Tracker/wiki/Meeting-Minutes).
- My status report from December 2024
- My weekly plan for completing work
- Any data produced during the initial user survey and the evaluation activity.
